            <p>
                I love writing simple code for complex problems. I have worked on writing
                drivers for downhole drill bits in C to creating visualizations (d3, .Net) for large datasets. With
                more than 6 years of experience I have been fortunate to work on a lot of great products like a
                distributed file system (.Net WPF C#) to a modeler to predict economic output of oil wells (C# ).
                Also, mentoring new hires to transition them by guiding them technically, business and culture.
